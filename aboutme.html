  <h3>Pushpa</h3>
    <p>
     Pushpa Raj is a coolie who works to smuggle red sandalwood, a rare wood that only grows in the 
     Seshachalam Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. When DSP Govindappa raids them in 
     the forest, Pushpa hides and recovers the stock, thereby gaining the trust of his employer Konda Reddy. With the help of novel ideas to smuggle the red sandalwood, he quickly rises through the ranks and becomes Konda Reddy's partner
